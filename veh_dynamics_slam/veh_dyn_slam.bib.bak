abstract = {[G2 cont trajectories - curvature is a polynomial function of arc$\backslash$nlength]$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe trajectory generation problem for mobile robots consists in providing$\backslash$na set of trajectories that are "smooth" and meet certain boundary$\backslash$nconditions. We present a method to generate curvature continuous$\backslash$ntrajectories for which the curvature profile is a polynomial function$\backslash$nof arc length. An algorithm based on the deformation of a curve by$\backslash$nenegy minimization allows to solve general geometric constraints$\backslash$nwhich was not possible by previous methods. Furthermore, we are able$\backslash$nto make into account the limitation of radius of curvature of the$\backslash$nrobot by controlling the extrema of curvature along the path.},

@article{Xu2012,
abstract = {In this paper, an efficient real-time autonomous driving motion planner with trajectory optimization is proposed. The planner first discretizes the plan space and searches for the best trajectory based on a set of cost functions. Then an iterative optimization is applied to both the path and speed of the resultant trajectory. The post-optimization is of low computational complexity and is able to converge to a higher-quality solution within a few iterations. Compared with the planner without optimization, this framework can reduce the planning time by 52{\%} and improve the trajectory quality. The proposed motion planner is implemented and tested both in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle in three different scenarios. Experiments show that the planner outputs high-quality trajectories and performs intelligent driving behaviors.},
